# &lt;markdown-element&gt;

A Markdown renderer that uses the Commonmark spec.  This is a replacement for the Polymer sponsored `<marked-element>`.  `<marked-element>` uses the somewhat outdated Marked parser, while `<markdown-element>` uses the up to date and better maintained [Commonmark parser](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js).
